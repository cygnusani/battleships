# How do I win?

Since I always fire first I have to pick a target at random. My target is one of the three ships in the center. This way I'm able to guide the torpedo enough to reach the edges on some occasions and always hit at least one ship.

The enemy changes the source. I know that he does not use the source from my torpedo and his torpedo never comes from the flagship nor the ship I targeted.

Considering all this best bet would be to guide my torpedo away from the source of the enemy.
